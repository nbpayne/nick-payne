## Great albums hang together. What takes an album from being a bunch of songs to a unified story?

Often the starting point for recording an album is sitting down and writing a list of all the songs you&rsquo;ve got. Really great albums have an internal consistency to them - a story that unites all the songs together. But, how do you go from a list, to a story?
{: .lead }


Very early on in this process I found myself trying to do just that. I had a list of songs and a big question mark saying, &ldquo;what makes these songs similar&rdquo;. Furthermore, I had a bunch of songs that I wanted to rock out on with a full band and a bunch of songs that echoed traditional folk influences and that wanted a traditional line up to play them. I wondered if it was even possible for these songs to be together or if I should choose between them and cast some aside.

<h3>Finding a theme</h3>

After writing a lot of lists an idea began to emerge. And the idea was this&hellip;

<ul>
<li>The album will have two halves (or sides if it ever gets pressed to vinyl).</li>
<li>Side A will be songs set in the present and played with a full band (drums, electric guitars, oh my!).</li>
<li>Side B will be songs set in the past and played with a tradition band (all acoustic).</li>
<li>Each song on a side will be paired with another song on the other side which will have the same topic.</li>
<li>Each side will follow the same order of topic.</li>
</ul>

It feels good having established a theme. It provides a rule to measure each song against - will this song build upon the theme or will it detract? If necessary I must discard a song that doesn&rsquo;t fit and let it&rsquo;s time be for later.

<h3>Co-writing</h3>

A significant challenge in putting together an album of twelve songs is to create variety within them. A really exciting way I am going to address this is by co-writing with some friends to fill out the remain songs I need. This allows some other influences to enter the work and to enhance it with something I couldn&rsquo;t give it by myself.

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">A surprising advantage that has come out of working out the theme and an order early, is where I am short a song it is very clear what that song should be about and what mood it needs to have.</p>

This gives me an incredible advantage going into a co-writing session to be able to say, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s write a song about <em>blah</em> in the mood of <em>blah</em>&rdquo;.

Already I&rsquo;ve finished a song about goodbyes with <em>Katie Brianna</em> and I&rsquo;ve started a song of salvation with <em>Megan Cooper</em>. In the next week I&rsquo;m hoping to start on a song about revenge with <em>Karl Broadie</em> and a song about death with <em>Lachlan Bryan</em>. That leaves a song about freedom to co-write with&hellip; suggestions please!

<h3>Road Testing and Demoing</h3>

In order to hone these new songs I&rsquo;ll be road-testing them at Karl Broadie&rsquo;s <em>Bunker Songwriter Sessions</em> on Tuesday nights at Coogee Diggers.


I&rsquo;ll also be recording and videoing demos of some of these songs to help shape the arrangement and emotion of the songs. First cab of the rank is <em>My Darling</em> that Katie and I wrote a fortnight ago. Your feedback is appreciated!
